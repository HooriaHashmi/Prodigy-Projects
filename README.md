Caesar Cipher Project
The Caesar Cipher is a basic method of secret writing. It’s named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to send confidential messages to his generals.

How it works:
Choose a shift value (also called a key). This is the number of positions each letter in the message will move.
Shift each letter of your message by that number forward in the alphabet.
If a letter reaches the end of the alphabet (like ‘Z’), it wraps around to the beginning (like ‘A’).

Why it’s simple:
It only shifts letters.
It doesn’t hide the structure of words or sentences.
It’s easy to crack with modern techniques
